JUCE Plugin Development Action Plan
Learn JUCE and develop a plugin via mini-projects and modular development.

Phase 1: JUCE Familiarization — Mini Projects
Build foundational knowledge in DSP, UI, state, and testing.

Project 1: Simple Gain Plugin ✔️
Goal: Basic audio processing with a gain parameter.
Learn: AudioProcessor, AudioProcessorEditor, parameter linking, basic CMake/build.
Test: Apply gain to a test signal in AudioBuffer, verify output (no VST build needed).
Project 2: Tempo-Synced LFO Modulator
Goal: Sine LFO synced to host BPM modulating gain.
Learn: AudioPlayHead::CurrentPositionInfo, phase accumulation, waveform generation.
Test: Simulate BPM/time, assert correct LFO phase and output range.
Project 3: ValueTree State + Preset Loader
Goal: Store state, load/save presets.
Learn: juce::ValueTree, UndoManager, MemoryBlock for serialization.
Test: Serialize state, deserialize into a new instance, verify consistency.
Project 4: CMake Testing Framework
Goal: Integrate Catch2 or GoogleTest.
Learn: Create non-GUI unit tests for DSP and state logic.
Test: Write unit tests for gain, LFO, and ValueTree logic.
Phase 2: Module-Driven Development Sequence
Develop and test modules in isolation (unit tests/CLI apps).

Module 1: LFO Shape Engine
Components: LFOPoint, interpolation (linear/spline), curve evaluators (Hermite/Catmull-Rom).
Functionality: Waveform generation/caching, transformations (scale/mirror).
Test: Evaluate generated shapes at various phases, check smoothness/bounds.
Module 2: Pattern Sequencer
Components: Grid structure for shape placement.
Functionality: Time division mapping (beats → seconds), playback engine, scroll/zoom logic.
Test: Given tempo/sequence/position, assert correct shape playback and smooth interpolation.
Module 3: Modulation Routing
Components: LFO → parameter target routing table.
Functionality: Depth, smoothing, phase control per route, thread-safe output.
Test: Simulate LFOs, verify parameter modulation over time with smoothing.
Module 4: Parameter Mapping
Functionality: Discover automatable parameters (mock host), assign LFO to parameter ID, basic mapping logic (mock UI).
Test: Create dummy parameters, simulate mapping, assert correct modulated output.
Module 5: Sync & Playback Logic
Components: Playhead transport listener.
Functionality: Time conversion (PPQ/bar/beat → seconds), handle host loop/transport/tempo changes.
Test: Simulate transport events, verify sequencer sync.
Module 6: UI System
Components: Shape editor, sequencer grid (zoom/scroll), routing panel.
Test: Render from mock data, simulate user interactions (unit tests/GUI harness).
Module 7: Preset & Undo/Redo
Functionality: Versioned ValueTree schema, command-based undo, serialization round-trip.
Test: Serialize/deserialize randomized states, verify equality; test undo stack.
Module 8: Host Integration Layer
Functionality: Configure formats (VST3 first), handle automation (mock tests), basic AAX/AU stubs.
Test: Run in JUCE's AudioPluginHost, verify parameters/automation.
Module 9: Testing Infrastructure
Functionality: Test runners per module, performance profiling stubs, preset randomizer for stress tests.
Test: Run all core logic without GUI/DAW.
Summary: Minimal Tests Per Module (No VST Build)
LFO Engine: Feed points, assert waveform correctness.
Pattern Seq: Simulate BPM/position, check active shape/value.
Routing: Feed LFO values, check parameter output/smoothing.
Parameter Map: Simulate mapping, verify modulation output.
Sync Logic: Mock playhead, check sequencer alignment.
Presets: Save/load state trees, assert consistency.
Undo: Mock commands, check stack/reverts.
UI (logic): Trigger repaints with mock data.
Phase 3: Cross-Platform Readiness and Refinement
Prepare the Windows application for broader compatibility and a better user experience.

Step 1: Cross-Compilation Setup
Goal: Configure the build environment to compile for macOS and other target platforms.
Learn: Setting up build tools (Xcode on macOS), cross-compilation CMake configurations, handling platform-specific code (if necessary).
Test: Successfully build the plugin for macOS (as a starting point).
Step 2: Performance Profiling and Optimization
Goal: Identify and address performance bottlenecks on different platforms.
Learn: Using profiling tools (e.g., Instruments on macOS, profilers in Visual Studio), optimizing DSP algorithms, memory management, and UI rendering.
Test: Measure CPU usage and performance under various loads on Windows and macOS, identify areas for improvement, and verify optimizations.
Step 3: Cross-Platform Testing
Goal: Ensure the plugin functions correctly and consistently across different operating systems and host applications.
Learn: Setting up testing environments on Windows and macOS with various DAWs (e.g., Ableton Live, Logic Pro X, Cubase), developing test plans for different functionalities.
Test: Run the plugin in multiple DAWs on both platforms, test all features, automation, preset loading/saving, and identify/fix platform-specific bugs.
Step 4: UI/UX Refinement
Goal: Enhance the user interface and user experience based on feedback and cross-platform considerations.
Learn: Gathering user feedback (if possible), iterating on the UI design for clarity and ease of use, ensuring consistent UI behavior across platforms, considering accessibility.
Test: Get feedback on the UI from potential users on different platforms, test the responsiveness and usability of the UI, and make necessary adjustments.
Step 5: Packaging and Deployment
Goal: Create distributable versions of the plugin for different platforms and plugin formats.
Learn: Creating installer packages (e.g., .dmg on macOS, .exe or .msi on Windows), understanding plugin format distribution requirements (VST3, AU, AAX), code signing for security.
Test: Install the generated packages on clean test systems for each platform and verify that the plugin installs correctly and is recognized by host applications.
Phase 4: Beta Release and Ongoing Maintenance
Release a beta version for wider testing and establish a plan for ongoing support and updates.

Step 1: Beta Program Setup
Goal: Organize a beta testing program to gather feedback from a wider audience.
Learn: Selecting beta testers, providing clear instructions and support channels, collecting and managing feedback.
Test: Distribute the beta version to testers on different platforms and gather their feedback on functionality, stability, and usability.
Step 2: Feedback Analysis and Bug Fixing
Goal: Analyze the feedback received from beta testers and address any reported issues.
Learn: Prioritizing bugs and feature requests, implementing fixes and improvements, maintaining a bug tracking system.
Test: Thoroughly test all bug fixes and implemented features before the official release.
Step 3: Official Release
Goal: Release the final version of the plugin to the public.
Learn: Preparing marketing materials, setting up distribution channels (e.g., your website, plugin marketplaces), announcing the release.
Step 4: Ongoing Support and Maintenance
Goal: Provide ongoing support to users and maintain the plugin with updates and bug fixes.
Learn: Establishing support channels (e.g., email, forums), responding to user inquiries, planning and implementing updates for new DAW versions, operating systems, or feature requests.
Test: Continuously test the plugin with new software versions and address any compatibility issues that arise.
