# Volume Control Plugin - System Dependencies

This file documents all system dependencies required for building the VolumeControlPlugin on Linux and WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux).

## Core Build Tools

- **build-essential** - Basic C/C++ development tools
- **cmake** (version 3.15 or higher) - CMake build system
- **pkg-config** - Helper tool for compiling applications and libraries

## GUI and Display Dependencies (Required by JUCE)

- **libgtk-3-dev** - GTK3 development libraries (for GUI support)
- **libwebkit2gtk-4.1-dev** - WebKit2GTK development libraries (for web content)
- **libx11-dev** - X11 development libraries (for window management)
- **libgl1-mesa-dev** - OpenGL development libraries (for graphics support)

## Audio Dependencies

- **libasound2-dev** - ALSA development libraries (for audio support)

## Font and Text Rendering Dependencies

- **libfreetype6-dev** - FreeType2 development libraries (for font rendering)
- **libfontconfig1-dev** - Fontconfig development libraries (for font configuration)

## Network Dependencies

- **libcurl4-openssl-dev** - libcurl development libraries (for network operations) - **CRITICAL: Must be properly linked**

## Installation on Debian/Ubuntu (including WSL)

To install all required dependencies on Debian/Ubuntu-based systems, run:

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y build-essential cmake pkg-config libgtk-3-dev \
  libwebkit2gtk-4.1-dev libasound2-dev libfreetype6-dev libfontconfig1-dev \
  libgl1-mesa-dev libcurl4-openssl-dev libx11-dev
```

## Automated Installation

The provided `setup_scripts.sh` script can automatically check and install all required dependencies:

```bash
# Make the script executable
chmod +x setup_scripts.sh

# Run the script
./setup_scripts.sh
```

The script will detect your distribution, check which dependencies are already installed, and install any missing ones (after asking for confirmation).

## WSL-Specific Information

When building in WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux), the following considerations apply:

1. All dependencies need to be installed within the WSL environment (not in Windows).
2. The CMakeLists.txt file includes explicit include and link directory configurations for GTK, WebKit2GTK, and libcurl to address potential path issues in WSL.
3. The plugins built in WSL will be Linux plugins (not Windows VST3s).
4. For testing the plugins on Windows, you would need to build them on Windows or set up a more complex cross-compilation environment.

## Verifying Dependencies

To check if a particular dependency is installed:

```bash
# For packages
dpkg -l | grep package-name

# For GTK3
pkg-config --modversion gtk+-3.0

# For WebKit2GTK
pkg-config --modversion webkit2gtk-4.1

# For libcurl
pkg-config --modversion libcurl

# For ALSA
pkg-config --modversion alsa
```

## Troubleshooting Missing Dependencies

If CMake cannot find a required dependency during configuration, ensure:

1. The package is installed.
2. The pkg-config files are properly set up.
3. For WSL environments, the include and link directories in CMakeLists.txt match your system.

For detailed path information, you can use:

```bash
# For GTK3
pkg-config --cflags --libs gtk+-3.0

# For WebKit2GTK
pkg-config --cflags --libs webkit2gtk-4.1

# For libcurl
pkg-config --cflags --libs libcurl
```

## Common Build Errors and Solutions

### Undefined References to libcurl Functions

If you see errors like:
```
undefined reference to `curl_easy_init'
undefined reference to `curl_easy_setopt'
undefined reference to `curl_easy_cleanup'
```

This means the libcurl headers were found, but the library isn't properly linked. The solution is to:

1. Ensure libcurl4-openssl-dev is installed
2. Make sure the CMakeLists.txt has the following:
   - `pkg_check_modules(CURL REQUIRED libcurl)`
   - `include_directories(${CURL_INCLUDE_DIRS})`
   - `link_directories(${CURL_LIBRARY_DIRS})`
   - Add `${CURL_LIBRARIES}` to the `target_link_libraries` section

This has already been fixed in the current CMakeLists.txt, but if you modify or create a new CMake configuration, remember to include these elements.
